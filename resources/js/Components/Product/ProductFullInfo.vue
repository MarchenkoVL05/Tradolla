        Over the years, Apple has built a reputation for releasing its products
        with a lot of fanfare – but that didn’t exactly happen for the MacBook
        Pro 2018. Rather, Apple’s latest pro laptop experienced a subdued
        launch, in spite of it offering a notable spec upgrade over the 2017
        model – along with an improved keyboard. And, as with previous
        generations the 15-inch MacBook Pro arrives alongside a 13-inch model.
        Apple still loves the MacBook Pro though, despite the quiet release.
        This is because, while the iPhone XS and iPad, along with the 12-inch
        MacBook, are aimed at everyday consumers, the MacBook Pro has always
        aimed at the creative and professional audience. This new MacBook Pro
        brings a level of performance (and price) unlike its more
        consumer-oriented devices. Still, Apple wants mainstream users to buy
        the MacBook Pro, too. So, if you’re just looking for the most powerful
        MacBook on the market, you’ll love this new MacBook Pro. Just keep in
        mind that, while the keyboard has been updated, there are still some
        issues with it. There’s enough of a difference between the two sizes
        when it comes to performance to warrant two separate reviews, and here
        we’ll be looking at how the flagship 15-inch MacBook Pro performs in
        2019. It's build quality and design is batter than elit. Numquam
        excepturi a debitis, sint voluptates, nam odit vel delectus id
        repellendus vero reprehenderit quidem totam praesentium vitae nesciunt
        deserunt. Sint, veniam?
